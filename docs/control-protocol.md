# GridCraft control protocol

Start the desktop app with a control port:

```sh
gridcraft --control 7979            # or GRIDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=7979
```

Then send newline-delimited JSON to `127.0.0.1:7979`, each request with the window's key (see
[Keys](#keys)). Every request line gets one reply line:

```json
{"id": 1, "key": "…", "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "cell.set", "params": {"cell": "B2", "input": "=SUM(A1:A9)"}}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"cell": "B2", "value": "45"}}
```

Errors come back as `{"id": …, "ok": false, "error": "…"}`.

## Keys

The channel runs any command, including opening and saving files, so it only obeys whoever can
read the window's key. When the port is bound, the app writes 64 random hex characters to
`control-key.local-<port>` in its settings folder and removes the file when the window closes:

| System | Key file for port 7979 |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/GridCraft/control-key.local-7979` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\GridCraft\control-key.local-7979` |
| Linux, BSD | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gridcraft/control-key.local-7979` (or `~/.config/gridcraft/…`) |

On Unix the file is readable by the user only. Every request carries the key as `"key"`. A request
without it, or with a wrong one, gets `{"ok": false, "error": "unauthorized: …"}` and the
connection closes, so other programs, other users of the machine and web pages posting to the
port can't drive the app. Request lines are limited to 64 MiB.

`gridcraft-cli send` and `gridcraft-cli mcp --connect` find the key themselves: from
`GRIDCRAFT_CONTROL_KEY` if set, else from the key file for the port. They send it only to
loopback addresses.

## Methods

| Method | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` | `{command, params}` | Runs any engine command (see `engine.commands` or `gridcraft-cli commands`) |
| `engine.commands` | `{search?}` | Every command: id, label, ribbon path, shortcut, params doc, enabled; `search` keeps those whose id, label or ribbon path contains it (case-insensitive) |
| `engine.journal` | | Commands run so far (replayable) |
| `document.inspect` | | Workbook summary: sheets, used ranges, tables, charts, names, selection, undo labels |
| `sheet.read` | `{range?, sheet?, formulas?, formatted?}` | Values (or formulas / displayed text) of a range |
| `cell.get` | `{cell?}` | One cell: value, formula, displayed text, style, merge, comment, link |
| `ui.inspect` | | UI state: ribbon tab, editor, open dialog, message, grid rect, scroll, perf |
| `ui.click` / `ui.drag` / `ui.move` | `{x, y, toX?, toY?, button?, count?, shift?, cmd?, alt?}` | Real pointer input in window points |
| `ui.cell.click` / `ui.cell.drag` | `{cell}` / `{from, to}` | Pointer input at a cell's centre (works in point mode while editing) |
| `ui.key` / `ui.text` | `{key, shift?, cmd?, alt?, ctrl?}` / `{text}` | Keyboard input (typing in the grid starts editing) |
| `ui.edit.begin` / `ui.edit.text` / `ui.edit.commit` / `ui.edit.cancel` | `{text?}` / `{move?: down\|right\|up\|left\|none}` | Drive the cell editor |
| `ui.ribbon` | `{tab}` | Switch ribbon tab |
| `ui.dialog` / `ui.dialog.set` / `ui.dialog.confirm` / `ui.dialog.cancel` | `{name}` / `{field, value}` | Open, fill in and confirm dialogs |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?}` | PNG of the window (base64 when no path) |
| `ui.set` | `{dark?, formulaBar?, ribbonCollapsed?}` | UI preferences |
| `ui.resize` / `ui.focus` | `{width, height}` | Window control |
| `app.open` / `app.save` / `app.quit` | `{path}` / `{path?}` | Files and lifetime |

Any other method name that is a command id (e.g. `home.bold`) runs that command.

Use `engine.execute` with `{command: "view.theme", params: {mode: "system"}}`
to choose the display theme; `mode` accepts `"system"`, `"light"`, or `"dark"`.
System follows live OS appearance changes and falls back to Light when the platform supplies no preference.
The saved choice remains System; new users still start in Light. The legacy
`view.darkMode` command and `ui.set {dark}` select a fixed Light or Dark theme.

`{command: "app.language.set", params: {language: "ja"}}` switches the interface language
(`code` is accepted as an alias for `language`); `app.language.english` and
`app.language.japanese` are shortcuts. Only interface chrome is translated, never command ids or
document text. The choice is saved in `ui.json`; with nothing saved the desktop app follows the
system language.

For a headless equivalent (no window), use `gridcraft-cli mcp` or `gridcraft-cli run`;
see [`mcp.md`](mcp.md) and [`cli.md`](cli.md).
